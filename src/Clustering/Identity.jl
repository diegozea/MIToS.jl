# Calculates percent identity of two aligned sequences
# No account of the positions with gaps in both sequences in the length
"""
Calculates the identity value between two aligned sequences.

The identity value is calculated as the number of identical characters in the i-th position of both
sequences divided by the length of both sequences.
Positions with gaps in both sequences are not counted in the length of the sequence.
Returns a value in [0, 1] range.
