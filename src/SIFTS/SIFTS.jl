"""
The `SIFTS` module of MIToS allows to obtain the
residue-level mapping between databases stored in the SIFTS XML files.
It makes easy to assign PDB residues to UniProt/Pfam positions.
Given the fact that pairwise alignments can lead to misleading association between residues in both sequences,
SIFTS offers  more reliable association between sequence and structure residue numbers.


**Features**

- Download and parse SIFTS XML files
- Store residue-level mapping in Julia
- Easy generation of `Dict`s between residues numbers
