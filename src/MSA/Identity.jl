# Similarity percent
# ==================

"""
Calculates the similarity percent between two aligned sequences. The 100% is the length of
the aligned sequences minus the number of columns with gaps in both sequences and the number
of columns with at least one residue outside the alphabet. So, columns with residues outside
the alphabet (other than the specially treated `GAP`) aren't counted to the protein length.
Two residues are considered similar if they below to the same group in a `ReducedAlphabet`.
The `alphabet` (third positional argument) by default is:

```julia
ReducedAlphabet("(AILMV)(NQST)(RHK)(DE)(FWY)CGP")
```

The first group is composed of the non polar residues `(AILMV)`, the second group is composed
of polar residues, the third group are positive residues, the fourth group are negative
residues, the fifth group is composed by the aromatic residues `(FWY)`. `C`, `G` and `P`
are considered unique residues.

**Other residue groups/alphabets:**
