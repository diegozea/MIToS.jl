### Quick DEV Guide

If you are not very familiar with development in *Julia*, you can start with
this simple approach.

 1. Clone the repo from *GitHub* and enter the repo directory

 2. Start *Julia REPL*
 3. Change to *Pkg* mode in *Julia* (press `]`) and activate the environment for
    the repo:
    
    ```
    pkg> activate .
    ```
 4. Go back to normal REPL mode (press backspace) and load
    [*Revise*](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl)
    
    ```
    julia> using Revise
    ```
 5. Load *MIToS*
    
    ```
    julia> using MIToS
    ```
 6. (optional) Check that *Revise* is tracking the correct files
    
    ```
    julia> Revise.watched_files
    ```

Edit the code, and the changes should be automatically loaded into the current
session.

Happy coding!
