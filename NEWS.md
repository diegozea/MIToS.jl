## MIToS.jl Release Notes

### Changes from v1.2.3 to v2.0

**MIToS 2.0** is the first MIToS version with **Julia 0.5** support
(It drops Julia 0.4 support). The last Julia version introduces new awesome features like
native multi-threading support, fast anonymous functions, generator expressions and more.
Also, the Julia package ecosystem has grown. So, MIToS was slightly redesigned to take
advantage of the new Julia capabilities. As a consequence, this version introduces several
breaking changes and new features.

##### Utils module

* `deleteitems!(vector::Vector, items)` is deprecated in favor of
`filter!(x -> x ∉ items, vector)`.

* `All` is used instead of MIToS 1.0 `"all"` or `"*"`, because it's possible to dispatch on it.

###### Vectorized queries are deprecated

Previous version of Utils included methods and types in order to overcome the performance
cost of functional programing in previous Julia versions. In particular, vectorized queries
were performed using subtypes of `AbstractTest`, in particular the `TestType`s `Is` and
`In` and the `TestOperation` `Not`. This types were used as argument to the query methods
`capture` and `isobject`. This operation were fused and vectorized with the methods:
`findobjects`, `collectobjects` and `collectcaptures`. All these functions and types are
deprecated in MIToS 2.0. Functional programming in Julia 0.5 is fast, so these methods
can be easily replace by Julia higher order functions like `find` and `filter` and lambda
expressions (anonymous functions).

##### MSA module

* `Residue` is now encoded as `Int` instead of being encoded as `UInt8`, allowing faster
indexation using `Int(res::Residue)`. More memory is used, since the residues are encoded
using 32 or 64 bits instead of 8 bits.

* `XAA` is now used to indicate unknown, ambiguous and non standard residues instead of `GAP`.

* Conversions to and from `UInt8` aren't supported now.

* More `Base` methods are extended to work with `Residue`: `bits`, `zero`, `one`
and `isvalid`.

* `empty(Annotations)` was deprecated, use `Annotations()` instead.

* `msa["seq_name",:]` now returns a `NamedArray{Residue,1}` instead of an aligned sequence,
use `getsequence(msa,"seqname")` to get an aligned sequence with annotations.

* The `names` function was replaced by the `sequencenames` function. A `columnnames`
function was also added.  

* Aligned sequences don't drop dimensions, so there are matrices instead of vectors. You can
use `vec(...)` or `squeeze(...,1)` to get a vector instead of the matrix.

* Indexing MSA objects with only one string is deprecated, use `msa["seqname",:]` instead
of `msa["seqname"]`.

* `empty!` doesn't take MSA objects anymore.

* `asciisequence` was replaced by `stringsequence`.

* `deletenotalphabetsequences` and the parse/read keyword argument `checkalphabet` are
deprecated since MIToS 2.0 uses Residue('X') to represent residues outside the alphabet. You
can use `filtersequences!(msa, vec(mapslices(seq -> !in(XAA, seq), msa, 2)))` to delete
sequences with unknown, ambiguous or non standard residues.

* `parse`/`read` and MSA file returns an `AnnotatedMultipleSequenceAlignment` by default.

* `shuffle_...columnwise!` and `shuffle_...sequencewise!` functions were deprecated in
favor of `shuffle!` and `shuffle` functions.

* `SequenceClusters` was renamed to `Clusters`.

* Residue alphabet types were added. All alphabet types are subtypes of `ResidueAlphabet`.
In particular, three types are exported: `GappedAlphabet`, `UngappedAlphabet` and
`ReducedAlphabet`. The last type allows the creation of custom reduced alphabets.

* In order to keep the sequence name, `AlignedSequence` and `AnnotatedAlignedSequence` are
now matrices instead of vectors.

##### PDB module

* The keyword argument `format` of `downloadpdb` should be a type (`PDBFile` or `PDBML`)
instead of a string (`pdb` or `xml`) as in MIToS 1.0.

* `read` and `parse` now has the `occupancyfilter` keyword argument.

* `read` and `parse` now has the `label` keyword argument for `PDBML` files.

* `residues`, `àtoms` and similiar functions don't take vectors or sets anymore. Use an
anonymous function instead, e.g.: `x -> x in set_of_residue_numbers`.

* The functions `isresidue`, `isatom` and `residuepairsmatrix` were added.

##### SIFTS module

* The `get` function has a more complex signature for `SIFTSResidue`s to make simpler
the access of data.

* `find`, `filter` and `filter` now takes a database type as a third parameter when a vector
of `SIFTSResidue`s is the second parameter. It allows to use a function that directly
operates over the database type if it's available.

* `SIFTSResidue`s now also store secondary structure data in the `sscode` and `ssname` fields.

##### Information module

* `ResidueProbability` and `ResidueCount` were deprecated in favor of `ContingencyTable`.
`Probabilities` and `Counts` were added as wrappers of `ContingencyTable` to allow dispach
in a some functions, e.g. `entropy`.

* The last parameter of contingency tables is now a subtype of `ResidueAlphabet` instead
of a `Bool`, i.e.: `UngappedAlphabet`, `GappedAlphabet` or `ReducedAlphabet`.

* Creation of empty contingecy tables chaged.
e.g. `zeros(ResidueProbability{Float64, 2, false})` changed to
`ContingencyTable(Float64, Val{2}, UngappedAlphabet())` and
`ResidueProbability{Float64, 2, false}()` changed to
`ContingencyTable{Float64, 2, UngappedAlphabet}(UngappedAlphabet())`.

* `count!` and `probabilities!` signatures changed. The first argument is alway a
`ContingencyTable`, the second positional argument a clustering weight object
(use `NoClustering()` to skip it), the third positional argument is a pseudocount object
(use `NoPseudocount()` to avoid the use of pseudocounts) and `probabilities!` takes also a
`Pseudofrequencies` object (use `NoPseudofrequencies()` to avoid pseudofrequencies). The
last positional arguments are the vector of residues used to fill the contingency table.

* `count` and `probabilities` now takes the sequences as only positional arguments. The
output is always a table of `Float64`. Both functions take the keyword arguments
`alphabet`, `weights` and `pseudocounts`. `probabilities` also has a `pseudofrequencies`
keyword argument.

* `apply_pseudofrequencies!` changed its signature. Now it takes a `ContingencyTable` and
a `Pseudofrequencies` object.

* The function `blosum_pseudofrequencies!` was deprecated in favor of introducing a
`BLOSUM_Pseudofrequencies` type as subtype of `Pseudofrequencies` to be used in
`probabilities`, `probabilities!` and `apply_pseudofrequencies!`.

* Because higher-order function are fast in Julia 0.5, measure types
(i.e. subtypes of `AbstractMeasure`) were deprecated in favor of functions. In particular,
`MutualInformation` was replaced with the `mutual_information` function,
`MutualInformationOverEntropy` was replaced with `normalized_mutual_information`,
`KullbackLeibler` was replaced with `kullback_leibler` and `Entropy` was replaced with
`entropy`.

* The functions `estimate`, `estimate_on_marginal` , `estimateincolumns` and
`estimateinsequences` were deprecated because measure types are not longer used.

* `estimate_on_marginal(Entropy...` was deprecated in favor of the `marginal_entropy`
function.

* `estimateincolumns` and `estimateinsequences` were deprecated in favor of `mapcolfreq!`,
`mapseqfreq!`, `mapcolpairfreq!` and `mapseqpairfreq`.

* Keyword argument `usegaps` is deprecated in `buslje09` and `BLMI` in favor of `alphabet`.

* `cumulative` function was added to calculate cumulative MI (cMI).
